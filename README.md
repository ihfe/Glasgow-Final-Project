Ⅰ、Most of the files are well-structured like below and you can just fold or un-fold it to have a look.

Ⅱ、The Code can directly run in the google colab if the test model is pre-training model in pytorch. However, for few models (like some Model after pruning) I saved these models in my google drive, so there will be errors if you run directly.

Ⅲ、For another model compression method "distill", If you are interested , welcome to have a look at https://github.com/ihfe/Knowledge-Distill-BERT. However, I have to say that it's explanation is IN CHINESE !!!
